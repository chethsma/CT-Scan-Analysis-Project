# CT Scan Analysis using Deep Learning
This project focuses on **CT Scan Analysis** using Deep Learning. The processing steps include:
1. **Loading and visualizing raw DICOM images**
2. **Applying windowing techniques**
3. **Converting to 3-channel image format**
4. **Extracting features based on different band ranges**
5. **Performing segmentation to detect regions of interest**

The project is implemented in **Python** using:
- `Pydicom` for DICOM processing
- `OpenCV & NumPy` for image manipulation
- `TensorFlow/Keras` for deep learning segmentation


## üì∏ **Step-by-Step Image Processing**
Below are the transformations applied to the CT scan images:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Raw DICOM Image**
This is the **original DICOM** scan before preprocessing.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ 3-Channel RGB Conversion**
Since medical images are grayscale, they are **converted into 3-channel format** for deep learning compatibility.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction Based on Band Ranges**
Different **HU (Hounsfield Unit) ranges** highlight different tissue types.

#### **a) Band Range 40 - 100 (Soft Tissues)**
Extracting only soft tissues from the CT scan.

#### **b) Band Range 400 - 1600 (Bones)**
This range isolates **bone structures** in the CT scan.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Final Segmentation Output**
A deep learning model is applied for **organ/tumor segmentation**.
